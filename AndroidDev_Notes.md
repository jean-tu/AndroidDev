# Android Development 

## Views 

* There are different rectangles on the screen that are part of the UI, it’s the basic building block for building the app 
    * Common Types: 
        * TextView 
        * ImageView 
        * Button 

## XML 
* XML Syntax - invalid XML won’t show up 
    * Open Angle bracket
    * Tag type 
    * Attributes 
    * Closing tags 

**Closing Tag Example:** 

```
<TextView 
	android:text="Happy Birthday" 
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```
A closing tag is when you have the `/>` at the end of the XML statement. You can either to that or close it with a regular closing angle bracket and to close the TextView, you do `</TextView>`

You define attributes that you want to change, or else it will continue with a default value.
