# AndroidDev	

This is a folder to keep track off all the different things that I am learning and to see what projects I have been able to build. 

I will have some notes written in markdown in a file called **"AndroidDev_Notes.md"**. 

Most of the things will be coming from the Udacity courses! 

There is a link to the Android Vocabulary: [Glossary URL](https://developers.google.com/android/for-all/vocab-words/?hl=en)
